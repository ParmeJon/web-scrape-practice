# Web Scraping with Node 
Here is my first time web scraping. Thought I should see first hand how it is.

## Packages Used
 - Axios 
    - Need this to fetch the Data
 - Cheerio
    - Use this to parse and help extract that data I want
    - Uses jQuery (i'm not too familiar but I'll learn)

## Install 

```
npm install
``` 

## Run

```
node index.js
```
